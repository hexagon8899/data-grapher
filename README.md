# grapher
grapher i made for graphing data generated from a function

# basic usage
firstly, download `grapher.py`

it is very simple to use:
 ```py
from grapher import Grapher
graph = Grapher(function)
graph.start()
```
`function` is a function that returns any data. you need to define it yourself
